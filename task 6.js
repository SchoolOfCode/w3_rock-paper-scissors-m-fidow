//Task 6: Scores
// Keep track of how many games have been played,
// as well as the number of wins, losses, and draws.

// This will be deemed as complete
// when this information is displayed after each round.

/* Plan
What I need
1. Games played
    - add to it at each turn
2. Number of wins
    - if player 1 wins and 1 is returned
3. Number of losses
    - if player2 wins and -1 is returned
4. Number of draws
      - if 0 is retuned.

[x] DEFINE GAMES_PLAYED VARIABLE
    [x]- INCREASE COUNT WHILE LOOP IS RUNNING
    [x]- ALERT BEFORE CONFIRM
DEFINE NUMBER_OF_WINS VARIABLE
- INCREASE COUNT IF RESULT =  1
- ALERT BEFORE CONFIRM
DEFINE NUMBER_OF_LOSSES VARIABLE
- INCREASE COUNT IF RESULT =  -1
- ALERT BEFORE CONFIRM
DEFINE NUMBER_OF_DRAWS VARIABLE
- INCREASE COUNT IF RESULT =  0
- ALERT BEFORE CONFIRM
